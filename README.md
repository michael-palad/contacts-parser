# Contacts Parser

Is a program written in Ruby that parses a contacts file and outputs the
information in a specific format. By default it reads the 'contacts.txt'
in the same directory where the program resides. A command line parameter
can be specified so it may read a different contacts file
(example: ruby process.rb another_contacts.txt).
